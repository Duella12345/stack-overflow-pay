## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using StackOverflow data from 2017 -2023 to better understand:

1. What were the most popular technologies over the past 5 years?
2. What were the top paying technologies over the past 5 years?
3. What will the top paying technologies be next year (2024) and are they related to the most popular technologies / top paying technologies from previous years?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict top paying technologies.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).
